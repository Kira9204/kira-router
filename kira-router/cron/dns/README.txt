To update your DNS records on DigitalOcean using curl, you'll need to use the DigitalOcean API.
This involves making a HTTP request to their API endpoint.
You'll need an API token (a personal access token),
which you can generate from the DigitalOcean control panel under API settings.
Once you have your token, you can use it to authenticate and perform API requests to manage your DNS records.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to update a DNS record using curl:

1. Generate an API Token
First, log in to your DigitalOcean dashboard and navigate to the "API" section in the left sidebar.
Here you can generate a new token by clicking on "Generate New Token". Make sure to give it read and write access.

2. Identify the Domain and Record ID
Before you can update a DNS record, you need to identify the domain and the specific record you want to update.
If you don't know the record ID, you'll first need to fetch the list of DNS records for your domain.

Fetch DNS records:
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/records"
Replace YOUR_API_TOKEN with your actual API token and YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME with your domain.
This will return a list of all DNS records for the domain, from which you can find the record ID for the record you want to update.

3. Update the DNS Record
Once you have the record ID, you can update the DNS record.
The specifics of the request depend on what you want to update (e.g., A record, CNAME record, etc.).

Example of updating an A record:

curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"data":"NEW_IP_ADDRESS"}' \
     "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/records/RECORD_ID"

Replace:
YOUR_API_TOKEN with your API token.
YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME with your domain name.
RECORD_ID with the ID of the DNS record you want to update.
NEW_IP_ADDRESS with the new IP address you want to assign to the record.

4. Verify the Update
After updating the DNS record, it's good practice to verify that the change has been made correctly.

curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/records"
This will show you the current state of all DNS records for your domain, including any updates you've made.

Notes:
DNS changes might take some time to propagate globally.
Ensure that your API token has the necessary permissions.
Handle your API token securely; do not expose it in shared scripts or repositories.
By following these steps, you can update your DNS records on DigitalOcean using curl and the DigitalOcean API.
